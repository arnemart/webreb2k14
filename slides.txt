# react.js

--
* Yes, itâ€™s another Javascript UI library
--
* (But it has some special tricks up its sleeves)
--
* Created by Facebook! Can you believe it
--
* Wonderfully limited in functionality


----

# So what does it do

--
* The V in MVC
--
* BYO routing/structure/persistence etc.


----

# Side note

--
* React has super helpful error messages
--

```javascript
React.div({
    style: "color: #a0df00; font-family: 'Comic Neue'"
});
```

--

_The 'style' prop expects a mapping from style properties to values, not a string._

--

```javascript
React.div({
    style: { color: '#a0df00', fontFamily: 'Comic Neue' }
});
```

----

# .jsx

~

~Or: There's always a catch

--
* JS: Not good enough
--
* JSX: Crazy
--

```javascript
var c = React.createClass({
    render: function() {
        return <div class="wat">
            <span>I'm HTML inside javascript</span>
            <span>Why do I exist</span>
        </div>
    }
});
```

--
* I don't like this so let's not spend any more time on it.
